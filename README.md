# Project1-Mastermind Browser Game

## Game History
  Mastermind was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.

  Starting in 1973, the game box featured a photograph of a man in a suit jacket seated in the foreground, with a young Asian woman standing behind him. The two amateur models (Bill Woodward and Cecilia Fung) reunited in June 2003 to pose for another publicity photo.
